      <h1>What is Vittoz?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome in this program Vittoz. Here you will find different
        guided exercises Vittoz. But festival I would like to invite you to
        discover doctor Vittoz and his works to better understand his method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roger Vittoz was a Suisse doctor of neurology during twentieth centaury.
        He saw in his patients a great psychic and emotional discomfort,
        fatigue, anxiety depression, insomnia and others disorders. Unlike Dr.
        Freud and others psychanalysts, who at the time were interested in
        unconsciousness, Vittoz said that only consciousness can help to find a
        balance. So, he developed a method consisting in mastering unconscious
        by conscious acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, several times we have closed the door without remembering
        if we have done so. We closed the door automatically without thinking
        about it, our unconscious acted without our conscious taking it into
        account. Acting in this way we often miss the present moment and our
        brain become very tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, Doctor Vittoz emphasizes the need to re-educate our
        brain so that our consciousness regains control of the unconsciousness.
        What doctor Vittoz calls the reeducation of brain control.
